# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration and Visualization

## Dataset
Ford GoBike System Data: This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found out that most bike users were subscribers and it seems most 
subscribers were working class because bike hiring was done at 0800hrs and 1700hrs that is time to
go to work time to leave. customers were either tourists visiting or personnel with other doings.
Also most bikers were male as compared to other genders.
Most bikers age distribution was between 20-40 years of age.

## Key Insights for Presentation
In this investigation I wanted to look at how and when bike riding was used.
The main focus was on age, time, user type and gender.
I started by cleaning the data i.e wrangling. That is I removed the null values,
assigning correct datatypes to columns. I started by analyzing and visualizing time and then went
a head and introduced other variables for more analysis.
